# Speedometer
Speedometer app using Android Studio


The app checks the mobile velocity at all times. 
If the speed is greater than 80km/h (speed limit), the user is overspeeding, the screen turns red and the event is registered on a sql database.

The user can check all the overspeeding points on the map. 

The application also supports 3 languages (greek, english and german).
